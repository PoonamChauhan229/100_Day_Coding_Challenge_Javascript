// Hey everyone, welcome back to Code with Poonam! ðŸŽ‰

// This is Day 27 of our 100 Days of Coding Challenge in JavaScript.

// Todayâ€™s challenge is all about **reversing words in a sentence** while keeping their order intact. ðŸ’¡
// This is a fun way to work with strings and arrays in JavaScript.

// Challenge Overview:
// Given a sentence, reverse each word individually but maintain the word order in the sentence.
// For example, the input "Welcome to JavaScript" should return "emocleW ot tpircSavaJ".

// Letâ€™s solve this step by step! ðŸš€

function reverseWords(sentence) {
    console.log("Original Sentence:", sentence);

    // Step 1: Split the sentence into an array of words
    const words = sentence.split(" ");
    console.log("Split into Words:", words);

    // Step 2: Reverse each word
    const reversedWords = words.map(word => word.split("").reverse().join(""));
    console.log("Reversed Words:", reversedWords);

    // Step 3: Join the reversed words back into a single sentence
    const reversedSentence = reversedWords.join(" ");
    console.log("Reversed Sentence:", reversedSentence);

}

// Example call to test the function:
const input = "Welcome to JavaScript";
reverseWords(input); // Expected output: "emocleW ot tpircSavaJ"


// Breakdown of the Example:
// 1. Split "Welcome to JavaScript" into ["Welcome", "to", "JavaScript"].
// 2. Reverse each word: "Welcome" â†’ "emocleW", "to" â†’ "ot", "JavaScript" â†’ "tpircSavaJ".
// 3. Combine the reversed words: "emocleW ot tpircSavaJ".

// Try this function with your own sentences to see how it works!
// This is a great challenge for practicing string and array manipulation in JavaScript.

// And thatâ€™s a wrap for today! ðŸŽ‰
