// Give me code for adding 2 numbers
// Wishing you all a Merry Christmas filled with joy, laughter, and lots of coding! Let's make this holiday season even brighter with some amazing JavaScript challenges! ðŸš€

// i=1 >> 4<3 >> false >> 
// i=2 >> 9<3 >> false >> 
// i=3 >> 1<3 >> true >> min=1 
// i=4 >> 6<1 >> false >> 
// i=5 >> loop terminate >> min=1

// Todayâ€™s challenge is inspired by a problem from the **CodeKata** section of GUVI. Shoutout to GUVI for providing such an amazing platform to practice coding challenges! ðŸ™Œ

// Why is this challenge useful?
// This challenge enhances problem-solving skills by teaching how to work with Fibonacci-like sequences and cumulative calculations. It also demonstrates efficient iterative techniques, avoiding recursion for better performance in real-world scenarios.

// Thanks for joining me, and don't forget to check out CodeKata on GUVI for more amazing challenges! ðŸ’»
// Keep coding, keep growing, and Iâ€™ll see you in the next video! âœ¨
